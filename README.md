# Multi-mineral-segmentation-of-micro-tomographic-images-using-a-convolutional-neural-network

This code automatically segments of micro X-ray-Computed Tomographic (micro-CT) images into multi-mineral labels using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
The CNN model is trained using labels of two sets of images of a Bentheimer sandstone that are segmented into pore, quartz, clay and feldspar using a sophisticated interactive workflow. 
The trained model is then used to segment a new set of images of the Bentheimer sandstone.
